# Make3d.in-Pratham-series-3D-printer
Praham series of 3d printer is the series of 3D printer such as pratham Desktop, pratham 3.0 and pratham monster and built volume is 200*200*250mm, 300*300*300mm, 500*500*500mm respectively. Designed by Tejas diyora and Jatin goti (CEO of make3d.in). The design is highly inspired by the fantastic Rostock, Kossell and Tantillus 3D printers. They are manufacturing of every single parts 3d printing machine since 2014 – but should be considered a work in progress and they are developing 1st large built volume 1000*1000*1000 mm. If you want check their product accuracy and performance, then we will provide one sample for you and if anyone want to do any 3D printing job work then we are accepting that proposal and happily work with them. I share you some details of our 3D printer, I hope you it will help you to find out best 3D printer, service and support.
